## LinkedIn Authentication Setup

To properly set up LinkedIn authentication in Firebase, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure LinkedIn OAuth 2.0

1. Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Console](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps)
2. Select your app (bossi)
3. Go to the "Auth" tab
4. Make sure the following redirect URIs are added:
   - http://localhost:3000/auth/callback (for development)
   - https://knock-eb7b5.firebaseapp.com/auth/callback (for production)
5. Make sure the following scopes are enabled:
   - openid
   - profile
   - email
6. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret

### 2. Enable LinkedIn Authentication in Firebase

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project (knock-eb7b5)
3. Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
4. Enable LinkedIn authentication
5. Add your LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Client ID: 78gxpbz0z1wt2s
   - Client Secret: (Your LinkedIn Client Secret)
   - Authorized redirect URIs:
     - http://localhost:3000/auth/callback (for development)
     - https://knock-eb7b5.firebaseapp.com/auth/callback (for production)

### 3. Verify Configuration

After setting up both LinkedIn and Firebase, you can verify the configuration by:

1. Running the app locally
2. Opening the browser console
3. Running `window.checkFirebaseConfig()`
4. Check the console output for any errors

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the "auth/configuration-not-found" error:

1. Make sure LinkedIn authentication is enabled in Firebase Console
2. Verify that the Client ID and Client Secret are correct
3. Check that the redirect URIs match in both LinkedIn and Firebase
4. Ensure the scopes match between LinkedIn and Firebase
